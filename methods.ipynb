                "To investigate the nonlinear transport properties of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ in the presence of strong disorder and Anderson localization, we employ the Nonequilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism. While the Kubo formula is widely used for linear response in clean or weakly disordered systems, the NEGF approach offers several critical advantages for our study:\n",
                "\n",
                "1.  **Large-Scale Disordered Systems:** We simulate large supercells (up to $400 \\times 400$ sites) to capture the localization length $\\xi$ near the critical point. Full diagonalization required for the Kubo formula is computationally prohibitive ($\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$) for such system sizes. The recursive Green's function (RGF) algorithm allows us to compute the necessary transport quantities with $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ scaling in the transport direction.\n",
                "2.  **Open Boundary Conditions:** NEGF naturally incorporates open boundary conditions via self-energies, which is essential for simulating realistic transport setups and avoiding finite-size artifacts associated with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of strong disorder.\n",
                "3.  **Anderson Localization:** The formalism directly computes the transmission probability, which is the defining quantity for the metal-insulator transition and Anderson localization, without relying on assumptions about the nature of the eigenstates.\n",
