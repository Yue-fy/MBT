I. Additional data
I.1. Magnon data for 5SL MnBi 2Te4
In the main text, we focused on 6SL MnBi 2Te4. For completeness, here we show the magnon data (and
the effect of E-field) in 5SL MnBi 2Te4. As shown in the TRMOKE data of 5SL MnBi 2Te4(Fig. S1), the
out-of-phase magnon is the most prominent mode, consistent with previous results [1]. We then study the
time-dependent magnetoelectric coupling αof 5SL MnBi 2Te4. As shown in Fig. S2, both the DC and AC E
field measurements do not show observable αoscillation.

I.2. Additional magnon data of 6SL MnBi 2Te4
I.2.1 Theoretical calculation of magnon in 6SL MnBi 2Te4
Using the standard Heisenberg model, we theoretically calculated the magnon modes in 6SL MnBi 2Te4.
Theoretically, we obtained six magnon modes, which can be classified based on the C2symmetry (Fig. S3).
Specifically, we found that two out of the six magnon modes (+1 A/−1A) resemble the in-phase and out-of-
phase modes in bilayer or in the bulk limit. By further comparing our calculation with our experimental data
(Fig. S4), we found that these two modes are likely to be the two experimentally observed magnon modes.
Figure S5 studies how the equilibrium spin angles affect the Berry curvature oscillation. In Figs. S5 a,b, the
spin equilibrium angle was set to the the same ( ±19.7◦) across all layers. In Figs. S5 c,dshould be different
for different layers. The spin equilibrium angles are calculated based on the Heisenberg model. We set the
angles of the top and bottom layers to be the same ( ±19.7◦). In particular, the angles of inner layers are
larger because the inner layers feel stronger exchange coupling. The corresponding Berry curvature oscillation
are similar to the previous, except for a small global shift (Fig. S5).

Fig. S6 presents the pump photon energy and pump polarization dependence of magnon data in WSe 2/6SL
MnBi 2Te4. The magnon data does not depend on the pump polarization or pump photon energy, which
suggests that the excitation mechanism is laser-heating induced coherent precession [2].

I.3. Additional static Kerr data
Firstly, Fig. S7 shows the static Kerr vs B⊥data in a 6SL MnBi 2Te4dual-gated device, which is consis-
tent with [3], therefore confirming that the sample remains even-layered structure after microfabrications.
Additional electric field dependence further demonstrates the magnetoelectric effect.

Secondly, In addition the optical detection of magneto-electric coupling is based on the assumption that
Kerr rotation measures magnetization.
1. As shown in Fig. S9, we can measure the magnetization Mzof bulk MnBi 2Te4as a function of Bzusing
SQUID and compare with the Kerr vs. Bzof 6SL MnBi 2Te4. Both the Kerr and Mzshow a linear
dependence on Bz, therefore suggesting that Kerr is proportional to magnetization in our system (Kerr
∝B∝Mz).
2. Fig. S8 ashows the probe wavelength dependence of the E-field induced Kerr rotation. Furthermore,
we theoretically calculated the E-field induced σxy, which shows a good agreement between data and
calculation, based on Kerr ∝σxy(λ)∝γ(λ)Mz. This result therefore suggests our conclusion that the
5

============================================================
PAGE 7
============================================================

measured E-field induced Kerr rotation in 6SL MnBi 2Te4indeed reflects the E-field induced magneti-
zation.
3. To further strengthen point 2 above, in our DFT calculation, we could calculate the E-induced σxyand
E-induced Mz. As shown in Fig. S10, both σxyandMzare linearly dependent on E. Hence, we could
obtain Kerr ∝σxy∝E∝M, which demonstrates the proportionality between Kerr rotation and Mz.
4. We further measured the doping ndependence of the∆Kerr
∆E(similar to the Fig. 4b of main text) using
three wavelengths. If∆Kerr
∆Evs.nis a good measure of α(n), then different wavelengths should give
consistent results. Indeed, our data (Fig. S11) show similar behavior. We further elaborate on the
logic: Because Kerr ∝γMz, its variation as a function of n, ∆Kerr /∆n, may come from ∆ Mz/∆nor
∆γ/∆n. If it comes from Mz, the ndependence should be the same function at various wavelengths
upon normalization. By contrast, if it comes from γ, then ndependence of γshould be different
functions at various wavelengths. Furthermore, our measured∆Kerr
∆Evs.nshows good agreement with
the theoretically calculated α(n). Therefore, collectively, these evidences suggest that the measured n
dependence mostly arises from changes in Mz.
5. Furthermore, we can achieve a symmetry-based, direct proof that our E-induced Kerr is measuring
E-induced magnetization. As shown in Ref. [3], magnetization Mzinduces both Kerr (reflection) and
Faraday (transmission) rotation. By contrast, the AFM order Lzonly shows up in Kerr but is absent in
Faraday. Therefore, if the E-field induced signal shows up in both reflection (Kerr) and in transmission
(Faraday), then it measures Mz. Figure S12 shows the simulatneous Kerr and Faraday measurements
at different DC Efield. we see that the linear-to- Eeffect exists in both reflection and transmission.
But in reflection, there is a nonzero offset at E= 0 due to the AFM Kerr; In transmission, the Faraday
rotation is zero at E= 0. Therefore, our simultaneous reflection and transmission measurements
directly prove that the observed linear-to- EKerr rotation is due to magnetization Mz.

Thirdly, static magnetic properties such as TNand the spin flop field Bspinflop can also serve as an
experimental check if JandKwere strongly modified by gating ( J: exchange coupling, K:anisotropy). As
shown in Fig. S13, TNandBspinflop do not show observable dependence on nandE, suggesting that Jand
Kare roughly invariant within the experimentally studied nandErange.

I.4. Additional DAQ data of 6SL MnBi 2Te4
I.4.1. Addressing competing mechanisms
We present additional data, to address competing mechanisms. In particular, if the electrostatic gating
strongly modifies the exchange coupling Jand magnetic anisotropy K, it might also change the TRMOKE
signal. Thus, we investigated the nandEdependence of the TRMOKE signals. In particular, in even-layer
MnBi 2Te4, there are in total eight distinct dependences. I.e., how does the frequency (orTRMOKE
amplitude ) of the in-phase (orout-of-phase ) magnon depend on n(orE). We found that the only
observed change is that the TRMOKE amplitude shows a linear Edependence at the out-of-phase magnon
frequency. If the exchange coupling Jand the anisotropy Kwere strongly modified by gating, then we would
expect both the frequency and TRMOKE amplitude of both magnon modes to show gate dependence (both
nandE). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the alternative effect that JandKare strongly
modified is unlikely to be origin. Rather, the DAQ is a more plausible and consistent interpretation. Below,
we present the corresponding data.

Figure S14: TRMOKE data of 6SL MnBi 2Te4at different B∥field (red and blue triangles represent out-of-

Figure S14 shows the TRMOKE data of 6SL MnBi 2Te4. The signal consists of both the AFM Kerr and
the regular Kerr, therefore can detect both the in-phase and out-of-phase magnons. As shown in Fig. S14,
the in-phase magnon is prominent at small B∥, whereas the out-of-phase magnon becomes
strong at large B∥.
We set B∥= 3 T, where the in-phase magnon is prominent. As shown in Fig. S15, the in-phase magnon
shows no observable nandEdependence in terms of both the frequency and TRMOKE amplitude.
We set B∥= 6 T, where the out-of-phase magnon is prominent. As shown in Fig. S16, the out-of-phase
magnon shows no observable ndependence in terms of both the frequency and TRMOKE amplitude as well
as no observable Edependence in terms of the frequency. The only observed change is that the TRMOKE
amplitude shows a linear Edependence at the out-of-phase magnon frequency.

I.4.2. Eand ndependence of TRMOKE measured by DC and AC methods
We now try to obtain the time-resolved αby DC Efield method, and show that the result is fully consistent
with the AC Efield modulation method adapted in the main text. Specifically, we first park the magnetic
field at B∥= 6 T, where the out-of-phase magnon is prominent. Figure S17 ashows the TRMOKE at different
DCEvalues (same data as Fig. S16). In order to obtain the time-resolved ∆ α, we subtract the TRMOKE
data at E=±1.6 V/nm and divide it by 3 .2 V/nm. The result, shown in Fig. Fig. S17 b, shows an oscillation
ofα. Therefore, we can detect the αoscillation (the DAQ) by DC Efield method; The result (Fig. S17 b)
is consistent with that of AC Efield lock-in method shown in Fig. S17 c(the AC data has better signal to
noise ratio).
Moreover, we can also the magnetic field at at B∥= 4.5 T, where both the in-phase and out-of-phase
magnons are excited. When we perform E-field dependence (both DC and AC), we can also see the α

oscillation at the out-of-phase magnon frequency with fully consistent results (Fig. S18).
Furthermore, we performed similar comparison between DC and AC doping ndependence. Figure S19
shows the TRMOKE data at ±nvalues (same data as Fig. S16). The TRMOKE does not show significant
change with n. As such, their difference (Fig. S19 b) is nearly zero. Consistent result is obtained if one AC
modulates the doping n(Fig. S19 c).

I.4.3. Doping dependence of DAQ data
In the main text, all ∆ αmeasurements were performed with the Fermi level at charge neutrality ( n= 0).
Here, we present the ndependence of ∆ αmeasurements for completeness. As shown in Fig. S20, the ∆ α
oscillation frequency remains the same at different nvalues, but the oscillation amplitude decreases as one
changes from charge neutrality ( n= 0) to both electron-doped and hole-doped regimes. This observation is
consistent with our static αversus nmeasurements shown in Fig. 4 bof the main text.

I.5. Phonon data of 6SL MnBi 2Te4
In the main text, we focused on the magnon-induced effect. We discuss phonon induced effect in this
section. Theoretically, we use DFT to compute the phonon frequencies at Γ point of 6SL MnBi 2Te4. As
shown in Fig. S23, the lowest phonon frequency is ∼160 GHz, which is much higher than the experimentally
observed DAQ frequency. Experimentally, we can observe the breathing phonon at ∼200GHz by time-resolved
reflectivity (∆ R/R) measurements, which is also consistent with [4]. In addition, we also investigated the
gate dependence of this phonon mode. As shown in Fig. S24, our data show no observable gate dependence
and no observable temperature dependence across TN.

the optical linear dichroism ( ∝M2

MnBi 2Te4. These experiments confirmed the expected magnetic ground state under a finite in-plane magnetic
field B∥. In addition, we present the optical images of all devices used in our experiments in Fig. S26.
Furthermore, Fig. S27 and Fig. S28 showed the reproducibility and symmetry analysis of the magneto-electric
effect.

II The AFM Kerr effect and DAQ probed with DC E-field
II.1. The AFM Kerr effect
The regular Kerr effect is proportional to magnetization Mz. However, in a PT-symmetric antiferromagnet
with zero magnetization (breaking PandTbut preserves PT) such as Cr 2O3[5] or even-layer MnBi 2Te4[3],
there is an AFM Kerr effect, which is proportional to the AFM order Lz. Moreover, the PT-symmetric AFM
order Lzleads to the AFM Kerr effect but no Faraday effect. By contrast, Mzleads to both nonzero Kerr
and Faraday effect. These conclusions have been experimentally demonstrated in MnBi 2Te4by Ref. [3].
•6SL MnBi 2Te4is aPT-symmetric AFM with zero net magnetization. It shows the AFM Kerr effect.
Moreover, it shows zero Faraday effect (Fig. S29).
•5SL MnBi 2Te4has an uncompensated magnetization ( Mz), which is like a ferromagnet. So it supports
both nonzero Kerr effect and Faraday effect, both proportional to Mz(Fig. S29).
Figure S29: The net magnetization Mzcan be probed by both Kerr and Faraday. The AFM order Lz
can only be probed by Kerr. These conclusions have been experimentally demonstrated by Ref. [3]. Here
we reproduce the Fig. 3 of Ref. [3]. We note that Kerr/Faraday have the same symmetry as RCD/TCD
(reflection circular dichroism and transmission circular dichroism).
II.2. The AFM Kerr rotation shows up as a DC offset at E=0
Therefore, for 6SL MnBi 2Te4, if we apply a DC Efield, we expect that the AFM Kerr ( ∝Lz) already shows
up at E=0 (i.e., a nonzero offset); on top of that, there will also be a regular Kerr ( ∝Mz) that is linearly
proportional to Efield due to the magnetoelectric coupling α. Indeed, this can be seen from our data under
DCEfield (Fig. S30). By contrast, if we apply AC Efield modulation, then the lock-in signal would only
detect the Kerr rotation that is linear to E(Fig. S30), therefore allowing us to isolate the magnetoelectric
coupling signal.

One important question is whether the AFM Kerr can also support a linear-in- Ecomponent. Here, we show
that, based on the symmetry analysis, the AFM Kerr can NOT have any linear-in- Econtribution. The
symmetry analysis is as follows: The AFM Kerr has distinct symmetry properties; it breaks PandTbut
respects PT. As a result, let us suppose the AFM Kerr has a linear-in- Ecomponent: AFM Kerr = χE. We
can perform PToperation to both sides of the equation. Under PT, AFM Kerr is invariant, but Ebecomes
−E. Therefore χ= 0. In other words, the AFM Kerr effect cannot have any linear-in- Ecomponent (it
can only have even powers of Eincluding E0). In the next subsection, we further prove that the observed
linear-in- EKerr purely comes from the E-induced magnetization, i.e., the magnetoelectric coupling.
II.4. The observed linear-in- EMOKE arises from E-induced magnetization

6SL MnBi 2Te4. Both Kerr and Faraday show an linear-in- Eeffect due to the E-induced Mz. The Kerr signal
has an additional offset at E= 0 due to the AFM Kerr effect.
We now aim to prove that the observed linear-in- EKerr comes from the E-induced magnetization. As
we discussed above, Mzwill induced both Faraday and Kerr rotation, but Lzwill only induce Kerr rotation.

Therefore, by testing if there is also an E-induced signal in Faraday effect, we can know if the E-induced Kerr
signal is AFM Kerr ( ∝Lz) or regular Kerr ( ∝Mz). We have performed new measurements to study Kerr
and Faraday simultaneously using DC Efield method. As shown in Fig. S31, our data clearly shows that the
linear-in- Esignal exists in both Kerr and Faraday. Therefore, our simultaneous reflection and transmission
measurements directly prove that the observed linear-in- EKerr rotation is the regular Kerr ∝Mz.

To further prove that the observed E-induced Kerr comes from magnetization. We note that formally,
the regular Kerr rotation measures the off-diagonal (Hall) part of the optical conductivity σxy, which has
identical symmetry properties as the out-of-plane magnetization Mz. Therefore, we can write Kerr( λ)∝
σxy(λ)∝γ(λ)Mz. In order to verify this, we have (1) experimentally measured the E-field induced Kerr
rotation as a function of the wavelength λand (2) theoretically calculated the wavelength dependence of
theE-field σxy(λ). As shown in Fig. S32, we see a good agreement between data and calculation, which
therefore strengthens our conclusion that the measured the E-field induced Kerr rotation in 6SL MnBi 2Te4
indeed reflects the E-field induced magnetization (i.e., the magnetoelectric coupling α).

We can further strengthen the logic of the above proof as follows: First, the good agreement of the
wavelength dependence demonstrates that our measured E-induced Kerr comes from E-field σxy(λ). This
proof is quite solid because it is not based on a single number (e.g. at one wavelength); Rather it is based on
the agreement of an entire curve (e.g. many wavelengths). Second, in our DFT calculation, we obtained the
E-induced σxy(λ) by calculating σxy(λ) at different Evalues. We can also calculate the net magnetization

Mzat those Evalues. Fundamentally, we first compute a band structure of 6SL MnBi 2Te4for every E
value, then the corresponding σxy(λ) and Mzcan be calculated based on the calculated band structure, see
expressions below. As shown in Fig. S33, both σxyandMzare linearly dependent on E. Hence, we showed
Kerr∝σxy∝E∝Mz.

Figure S34: TRMOKE data of 6SL MnBi 2Te4(no WSe 2) at different B∥field (red and blue triangles represent
out-of-phase and in-phase magnons).
We now proceed to the time-resolved MOKE data. We have shown that the MOKE signal consists of two
parts: the regular Kerr and the AFM Kerr.
•The regular Kerr is proportional to the net magnetization Mz. Hence, it can detect the in-phase
magnon, because the in-phase magnon features an oscillating Mz.
•The AFM Kerr is proportional to the AFM order parameter Lzreported in [3]. Hence, it can detect
the out-of-phase magnon, because the out-of-phase magnon features an oscillating Lz.
As shown in Fig. S34, both magnon modes are observed. The in-phase magnon is prominently excited
at small B∥, whereas the out-of-phase magnon is prominently excited at large B∥.
II.6. TRMOKE at different DC Eand nvalues
We set B∥= 3 T, where the in-phase magnon is prominent. As shown in Fig. S35, the in-phase magnon
shows no observable nandEdependence in terms of both the frequency and TRMOKE amplitude.
We set B∥= 6 T, where the out-of-phase magnon is prominent. As shown in Fig. S36, the out-of-phase
magnon shows no observable ndependence in terms of both the frequency and TRMOKE amplitude as well
21

============================================================

as no observable Edependence in terms of the frequency. The only observable effect is that the TRMOKE
amplitude shows a linear in Edependence at the out-of-phase magnon frequency, which is exactly the α
oscillation. These systematic data also provide an important cross-check in terms of what is observable/not
observable: 7 out of 8 dependences show no effect NOT due to insufficient resolution; Under the same
conditions, we clearly observe linear E dependence of TRMOKE amplitude at the out-of-phase frequency.

Fig. S37 presents a summary of the above results. In 6SL MnBi 2Te4, we have systematically studied in
total eight distinct dependences. I.e., how does the frequency (or TRMOKE amplitude) of the in-phase (or
out-of-phase) magnon depend on n (or E). Seven out of eight dependences show no observable effect. The
only exception is that the TRMOKE amplitude shows a linear-in Edependence at the out-of-phase magnon
frequency, which is the αoscillation. Moreover, we further show in SI.I (see Figs. S1 and S2) that there is no
gate dependence for the TRMOKE of 5SL layer MnBi 2Te4. If the exchange coupling Jand the anisotropy κ
22

============================================================
PAGE 24
============================================================

were strongly modified by gating, then we would expect both the frequency and TRMOKE amplitude of both
magnon modes to show gate dependence (the ndependence is typically even stronger than Edependence,
according to previous studies in Cr 2Ge2Te6[6] and CrI 3[7]). Also, we would expect similar effect in both
even and odd layers. By contrast, if Jandκare roughly unchanged but the results were due to the DAQ
(theαoscillation), then we would only expect a linear-in- ETRMOKE signal at the out-of-phase magnon
frequency in even layer. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the alternative effect that Jandκare
strongly modified is unlikely to be origin. Rather, the DAQ is a more plausible and consistent interpretation.

II.7. DAQ probed DC Efield
We now try to obtain the time-resolved αby DC Efield method, and show that the result is fully consistent
with the AC Efield modulation method adapted in the main text. Specifically, we first park the magnetic
field at B∥= 6 T, where the out-of-phase magnon is prominent. Figure S38 ashows the TRMOKE at different
DCEvalues (same data as Fig. S36). In order to obtain the time-resolved ∆ α, we subtract the TRMOKE
data at E=±1.6 V/nm and divide it by 3 .2 V/nm. The result, shown in Fig. Fig. S38 b, shows an oscillation
ofα. Therefore, we can detect the αoscillation (the DAQ) by DC Efield method; The result (Fig. S38 b)
is consistent with that of AC Efield lock-in method shown in Fig. S38 c(the AC data has better signal to
noise ratio).
Moreover, we can also set the magnetic field at at B∥= 4.5 T, where both the in-phase and out-of-phase
magnons are excited. When we perform E-field dependence (both DC and AC), we can also see the α
oscillation at the out-of-phase magnon frequency with fully consistent results (Fig. S39).

III.2 Future steps to build a functioning Axion detector
We describe the future experimental preparations that are needed in order to build a functional Axion
detector based on our DAQ material.
1. Sample size: For the photon counting approach, we need the sample area needs to be 0 .16 m2and
the thickness of 0 .4 mm. MnBi 2Te4has been grown by MBE [14] which solves the sample area issue.
Large thickness is more challenging. As shown in the main text, the DAQ in 6L MnBi 2Te4relies on
the finite thickness hybridization gap. We propose to grow mm-thick samples that consist of repeating
superlattice between 6L MnBi 2Te4and spacer layer such as Al 2O3. In this way, the 6L MnBi 2Te4films
are isolated from each other but the total thickness can be large. We can first test the superlattice with
smaller total thickness (e.g. 100nm) to optimize its quality and growth speed. Then we can grow a 0.4 mm
thickness superlattice, which we estimate to take multiple weeks [15]. Apart from MnBi 2Te4, Mn 2Bi2Te5
is a new bulk crystal that can be viewed as a natural superlattice between bilayer MnBi 2Te4and Bi 2Te3,
where theory has predicted large DAQ [16]. Large, mm size single crystals have been synthesized [17,18].
Beyond the Mn-Bi-Te based materials, we have discussed the possibility of searching for large DAQ in
multiferroic insulators, which can be a future direction.

we used a pump laser of visble photons ( ℏω≃2.5 eV), which is off
resonance and relies on the laser-heating induced coherent spin wave
excitation. Hence our pump laser only excited the DAQ (i.e., the out-
of-plane magnon) at frequency/mass mDM= 44 GHz= 0 .18 meV. If
we use low energy photons that are close to the resonance, then those
photons and the DAQ (i.e., the out-of-plane magnon) can hybridize to
form Axion polaritons (magnon polaritons), which can be understood
as the gap opening and level-repel picture shown in Fig. S41. The top

6L MnBi 2Te4by the scanning near-field optical microscope (SNORM)
[19].

PAGE 28
============================================================

3. Losses: Material imperfection (residue conductivity and magnetic impurities) can lead to damping of
the electromagnetic waves inside the material. Right now we have Γ ρ= 0.2×10−3and Γ m= 0.7×10−3.
If we can improve the sample purity, especially suppressing the residual conductivity and reduce the Mn
antisite defects, then one can reach the higher sensitivity than the results in Fig. 4g of main text.
4. Single photon detector efficiency: The single photon detector in the THz regime is rapidly
developing. We estimate our sensitivity based on a THz single-photon detector with efficiency ∼95%
and dark-count rate of 10−5Hz. This is an reasonable projection because the superconducting nanowire
single-photon detector has achieved simultaneously such a low dark count and high efficiency in near
infrared regime [20,21]. The same technology is progressing steadily to the longer wavelength [22] where
our DAQ detector shall be able to search for the dark matter axions.
III.3 Comparison between the meV DAQ detector and two other proposed
future detectors
There is no existing detector in the meV regime. The only two proposed future detectors (called BRASS
[23] and BREAD [24]) are based on the same detection mechanism: under a Bfield, use a giant focusing
mirror to focus all dark matter-induced photons (independent of their frequencies) and detect them with
single-photon detectors. The earlier BRASS proposal considered a parabolic focusing mirror, which is
difficult to integrate into a dilution refrigerator. The more recent BREAD proposal considered a conical
focusing mirror that can be compatible with a dilution refrigerator.
We list the pros and cons for our DAQ detector when comparing these two proposed detectors.
Advantages:
•Frequency resolution and tunablility: At a given magnetic field, the DAQ detector is only sensitive
to a particular frequency given byq
m2
DAQ+C2B2. By varying the magnetic field, we can scan different
frequencies. By contrast, the BRASS and BREAD focus all photons independent of their frequencies
and detect them at once (if using the single photon detectors with better signal to noise). Therefore,
their approach loses all information on the photon frequency, and thus on the axion mass, whereas the
DAQ approach would immediately give the axion mass.
•Economy: The BRASS and BREAD essentially collect all photons without resonant enhancement.
Therefore, to get a large signal requires a large focusing mirror. To achieve sufficient sensitivity, the
area of the mirror was estimated to be A= 10 m2. For BRASS, the parabolic mirror is incompatible
with dil fridge. For BREAD, a A= 10 m2solenoidal focusing mirror requires a very large dil fridge
with magnet to house it. This is estimated to cost about tens of millions USD. By contrast, the DAQ
sample can easily fit in any commercially available dil fridge, which costs about 600K USD.
Disadvantages:
•Scanning time and sensitivity: The key disadvantage of the DAQ approach is the need to scan
many frequencies. In our estimations in the main text, the measurement time on a single frequency
isδτ= 50 minutes, while the total measurement time is τ= 3 years. By contrast, the BRASS and
BREAD can detect a wide range of frequencies at the same time simultaneously, but with no frequency
resolution and no boost factor. Our estimation found that the broadband approach is more sensitive
than our proposed DAQ detector by a factor of around 5 (see detailed calculation below). Improving
the loss factor of the DAQ material in future (increase β), and using larger/multiple samples to increase
the area then the DAQ sensitivity can be comparable with the broadband approach.
For the broadband approach, to cover a wide range requires multiple receivers. BRASS estimated
N= 9 receivers in their proposed range [25]. For the same photon detector, the sensitivity in the
broadband approach compared to the DAQ approach is:

Forβ≈100,δτ= 50 min and τ= 3 years /Nand equal areas the approaches are comparably sensitive,
with βcompensating the differing measurement time. Using our area of Ares= 0.16 m2compared to
BREAD [24] Ab.b.= 10 m2the broadband approach is more sensitive than our proposed DAQ detector
by a factor of around 5. Note that this improved sensitivity is only achieved once the total campaign has
been completed. The resonant DAQ detector achieves design sensitivity on each frequency in a shorter
time.

IV. Theoretical derivation for the layer Hall effect
As aPT-symmetric material, even-layer MnBi 2Te4hosts the so-called layer Hall effect [26], which mani-
fests as an out-of-plane Ez-induced AHE. Here we show that the electric-field-induced AHE σxymeasures
dD/dn. The anomalous Hall conductivity is given by
σxy=e2
2πhZ
εnk≤µΩ(k)dk (S4)
=e2
2πhZ
εnk≤µ[ΩT(k) + Ω B(k)]dk (S5)
In the second line, we have used the fact that in MnBi 2Te4, the Berry curvature is dominated by the
low-energy surface bands localized on the top and bottom surfaces. Because we have Ω T=−ΩB, the
AHE conductivity vanishes in even-layer MnBi 2Te4. Upon applying the out-of-plane electric field Ez,
Ezcreates an imbalance of chemical potential (charge density, ∆ n) between the top and bottom layers.
Therefore, the AHE conductivity under finite Ezis given by
σxy=e2

V. Tight binding model for MnBi 2Te4
The tight binding model Hamiltonian used in order to describe the few layer MnBi 2Te4was inspired by
the earlier works on Bi 2Te3, where the low energy bands are represented by the bonding ( P1+
z) and the
anti-bonding ( P2−
z) states formed by Bi pzand Te pzorbitals [27]. The model is designed to describe four
low energy bands (including the spin degrees of freedom) per quintuple layer near the Γ(0 ,0,0), point.
The basis set is given by,
|P1+
z,↑⟩,|P2−
z,↑⟩,|P1+
z,↓⟩,|P2−
z,↓⟩. (S6)
The±sign denote the parity of the states, while the ↑,↓indicate the spins in the zdirection. Various
symmetry aspects of this model is explained in detail in Ref [28] as well as in Ref [29]. The bulk
Hamiltonian without any magnetization is expressed as,

The few-layer thick MnBi 2Te4is modeled by discretizing the bulk Hamiltonian along the zdirection
and coupling individual MnBi 2Te4layers with symmetry allowed interlayer hoppings. The AFM order is
included by adding a layer-dependent exchange coupling to the non-magnetic Hamiltonian [30]. In the
layer basis, the magnetic part of the Hamiltonian is expressed as,
hAFM =mA.s⊗τ0 0
0 mB.s⊗τ0
(S10)
Here, A and B represent the two layers of the AFM unit cell. Different spin configurations representative
of the magnon modes are described by controlling the magnetization parameter of each layer, mi=miˆmi,
where, the ˆ mi= (cos ϕisinθi,sinϕisinθi,cosθi) is the unit vector along the direction of the magnetic
moment. The θandϕrepresent the angles of the spherical polar coordinates. In order to model the
pristine MnBi 2Te4thinfilm with the out-of-plane AFM order, we have used mA=mB= 30 meV, and
θA=π,θB= 0,ϕA=ϕB= 0.

VI. Additional discussion
1. The polar Kerr rotation can arise from the normal Kerr proportional to Mzas well as the AFM Kerr
proportional to Lz. By the symmetry analysis, one can show that the AFM Kerr can NOT have
any linear-to- Econtribution, so the linear-to-E Kerr rotation can only arise from the normal Kerr
proportional to Mz. The symmetry analysis is as follows: The AFM Kerr has distinct symmetry
properties; it breaks PandTbut respects PT. As a result, suppose the AFM Kerr has a linear- E
component: AFM Kerr = χE. We can perform PToperation to both sides of the equation. Under
PT, AFM Kerr is invariant, but Ebecomes - E. Therefore χ= 0. In other words, the AFM Kerr effect
cannot have any linear- Ecomponent (it can only have even powers of Eincluding E0). Therefore,
the linear- Edependent Kerr purely comes from the E-induced magnetization, i.e., the magnetoelectric
coupling.
2. Our experiments focused on a relatively small doping range ±8×1012cm−2near charge neutrality;
Within this small range near charge neutrality, our data demonstrate that the magnetic properties of
MnBi 2Te4are roughly unchanged. On the other hand, if one accesses much larger doping level, it is
entirely possible that JandKof MnBi 2Te4could be modified due to the p−dcoupling. Here, we
provide some rough estimation according to previous works. In Ref. [31], the authors studied the Tcof
Mn-doped Bi 2(Te/Se) 3as a function of n. It was shown (Fig. 2 of that paper) that Tcstarts to change
asngoes beyond 1013cm−2). It should be noted that in Mn-doped Bi 2(Te/Se) 3, Mn ions are dilute
and randomly distributed, so the Mn-Mn exchange coupling entirely relies on the RKKY interaction
(p−dcoupling) through the itinerant electrons. By contrast, in MnBi 2Te4, the exchange coupling
mainly arises from the Mn-Mn super-exchange. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that, in order to
for MnBi 2Te4to show a strong change of TN(therefore magnetism), one would need to vary nto an
even larger value such as high 1013or 1013cm−2.
3. Why the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling αis zero above TN, even though MnBi 2Te4in the nonmagnetic
state is topologically nontrivial:
First, as a starting point, this ( α= 0) can be argued by a general symmetry analysis. The magneto-
electric (ME) coupling can be expressed by M=αE. We apply time-reversal operation to both sides
of the equation, under which Mflips sign but Eremains invariant. Therefore, the only way for this
to make sense is to have α= 0, i.e., the ME coupling αvanishes with time-reversal symmetry. This
symmetry requirement is general, meaning that it is true for any kind of ME coupling (topological or
trivial).
Second, we discuss specifically for the case of strong TI with time-reversal symmetry. The strong
TI has a nontrivial θ, but it only manifests as a quantized αif we gap out the Dirac surface states.
This can be seen from the pioneering theory papers. For example, in the following two theoretical
works [32,33], the authors showed the proposed setup to observe quantized α(see Fig. 15a of Ref. [32]
and Fig. 2b of Ref. [33]). In both works, the strong TI is interfaced with ferromagnetic insulators so
that the Dirac surface states are gapped. In this setup, the bulk (i.e., the interior) of the TI can still
remain time-reversal symmetric, but the surface is gapped out by interfacial time-reversal breaking.
The gapped Dirac surface states have a nonzero Hall conductivity, and the Hall current wraps around
the sample, generating the quantized α. By contrast, if we have a stand-alone strong TI without the
ferromagnetic insulators, then the strong TI has gapless Dirac surface states. The entire sample, which
includes the bulk and the surfaces, have time-reversal symmetry. Then the αshould vanish because of
the time-reversal symmetry of the entire sample, even though the system has nontrivial topology. This
fact has also been explicitly stated by another early theory paper [34]: Quote: “Next we analyze the
case of a strong Z2topological insulator having θ=π, or equivalently. We first consider a sample of
such a system that has T symmetry conserved at its surfaces, as in Fig. 1(a). Again, since the entire
sample is T-symmetric, its experimentally measurable magnetoelectric coupling tensor βclearly has to
vanish”. (Their βis our αhere).
